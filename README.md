One Repo to rule them all, One Repo to find them, One Repo to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them... 

Hi everyone,

Turgut here, I am currently learning programming and other related stuff in order to find an IT job.
It is quite hard for me to do that, as I have no experience in this field. I studied mechanical engineering from 1999 to 2003 and then spent my years working in a totally different area. I can no longer follow that path and need to find a paying job as soon as possible.
